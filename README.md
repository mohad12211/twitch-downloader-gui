# twitch-downloader-gui

This is a gui wrapper for the cli version of the great project [TwitchDownloader](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader), Linux only.
I used the library [libui-ng](https://github.com/libui-ng/libui-ng) with a few extra [patches](https://github.com/mohad12211/libui-ng).
The library is still in mid-alpha, but it's a promising project, simple, cross-platform (macos can be done, I just don't care much about it) and very intuitive.

# Preview

# Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a just wrapper for the CLI, you still need the `TwitchDownloaderCLI` binary. By default the app will try to find the binary from your `PATH`,
if you don't want to put `TwitchDownloaderCLI` in your `PATH` you can specify the binary path from the settings. Make sure that `TwitchDownloaderCLI` is executable.**


Packages available for debian, fedora And [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twitch-downloader-gui).
